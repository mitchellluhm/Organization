# .org to .csv file

## Idea

Read in an `.org` file that makes use of `org-clock` and its `org-clock-in` and `org-clock-out` features which records the time it takes to do tasks. Group time segments by a combination of duration, date, and subject (topic of that task). Organize those time segments into a `.csv` file. Plot the data into R graphs to help determine how you are spending your time.
